#  Vinlawz — Tactical Military Portfolio

> **Mission Brief:** A cyber‑military themed developer portfolio built to demonstrate discipline, structure, security mindset, and full‑stack engineering capability.

##  Overview

This repository hosts a **tactical, cyber-military inspired developer portfolio** engineered to showcase professional software discipline, security awareness, and production-ready Django development.

It is designed for **technical reviewers, recruiters, and engineers** who value:

* Clean system architecture
